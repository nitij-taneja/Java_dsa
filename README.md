# Java DSA Repository

Welcome to the **Java DSA Repository**! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains solutions to various coding problems related to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in **Java**. It includes problem-solving approaches and assignments from different platforms, as well as coursework submissions from my **Integrated M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in Computational Thinking and Data Science** at **VIT Bhopal University**.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
* **Assignments**: Contains Java DSA problem assignments submitted as part of my coursework.
* **Platform Problem Solutions**: Solutions to coding problems from different competitive programming platforms like:
  * **LeetCode**
  * **HackerRank**
  * **GeeksforGeeks**

## Topics Covered

* **Arrays**
* **Linked Lists**
* **Stacks & Queues**
* **Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees**
* **Dynamic Programming**
* **Sorting & Searching Algorithms**
* **Graph Algorithms**
* **Recursion**
* **Hashing**
* **Greedy Algorithms**
* **Backtracking**
* **Other core DSA concepts**

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the folders and explore the solutions. Each problem/assignment contains:
* The problem statement
* Approach/Explanation of the solution
* Java code implementation

## Future Plans

I will keep updating this repository as I work on more assignments and solve problems on different platforms.
